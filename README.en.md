## Usage Guide

### Download JDK Online
1. Select JDK distribution and version
2. Choose download directory
3. Click download and wait for completion

### JDK Download Sources
- Oracle JDK: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

### Download Recommendations
- Recommend using LTS (Long Term Support) versions for production environments
- If download fails, try:
  1. Using proxy or VPN
  2. Switching to another distribution
  3. Downloading directly from official website and importing manually
- Some versions might be unavailable due to end of support, check each distribution's lifecycle policy

### Local JDK Management

1. Select target JDK from the list
2. Click "Switch Version"
3. Wait for the switch to complete

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Windows
- Version switching using symbolic links
- Administrator privileges required for system environment variables
- Native symbolic link support for Windows 10/11

#### macOS
- Support for Homebrew-installed JDKs
- Version switching using symbolic links
- Automatic shell config file updates (bash/zsh)
- Admin privileges required for symbolic links

#### Linux
- Support for apt/yum package manager installed JDKs
- Version switching using symbolic links
- Automatic shell config file updates (bash/zsh/fish)
- Sudo privileges required for symbolic links

### Notes
- Recommended to use ZIP version of JDK to avoid conflicts with installed versions
- First-time use requires administrator/sudo privileges for environment variable configuration
- If download fails, try manual download option
- Unix systems (macOS/Linux) need to reload shell config file for environment variables to take effect

### IDE Integration
This tool seamlessly integrates with mainstream IDEs (such as IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse). By configuring your IDE to use the symlink path, you can achieve automatic synchronization between IDE environment and system JDK version.

#### Quick Setup
1. Use symlink path (default location):
   - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\jvman\current`
   - macOS: `/usr/local/opt/jvman/current`
   - Linux: `/usr/local/jvman/current`

2. Common IDE configuration examples:
   - IntelliJ IDEA: Configure JDK path in Settings > Build Tools > Gradle/Maven
   - VS Code: Configure java.home in settings.json
   - Eclipse: Add JDK path in Installed JREs
